# About

Hello. I'm a programmer working in the games industry. I've worked in indie and AAA games, getting my feet wet in a variety of areas, but I'm mostly interested in AI and network programming for multiplayer games.

This website is to contain my various musings, studies and personal projects. I'm currently in the process of migrating content from my old blog to this site, so there's not much here yet besides some links.

# Credits

I'm currently working on an exciting and ambitious multiplayer game project at [Ubisoft Reflections](https://reflections.ubisoft.com/). I can't wait to talk about that, but until then, here are some of the other games I've worked on:

* [Worms W.M.D](https://www.team17.com/games/worms-w-m-d/)
* [My Time at Portia](https://www.team17.com/games/my-time-at-portia/)
* [Mugsters](https://www.team17.com/games/mugsters/)
* [Auto Club Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_Club_Revolution)
